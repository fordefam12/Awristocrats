It was the first mass-production Cartier powered by an in-house movement, something previously only found in a handful of high-end watches by the Parisian brand. The round case is bold and modern, while the traditional sword-shaped hands and Roman numerals add a touch of the iconic Cartier flair. A bracelet option was added to the collection in 2011, while 2012 saw the introduction of the chronograph. The rather surprising Diver was introduced in 2013, pairing the Cartier aesthetics with true ISO dive watch specs. A smaller version of the regular Calibre de Cartier was introduced in 2015. Contrary to the larger version, this 38mm Calibre does not feature the triple date window, nor the half Roman\/ half stick dial.",

            "description": "The star of Patek Phillipe's highly anticipated 175th anniversary collection.\r\n\r\nThe Grandmaster Chime is sans doubt Patek's most impressive feat of modern times. It features an array of functions housed in a massive 47.4 * 16.1mm rose gold case made up of 214 components, while its movement consists of no less than 1.366 parts.\r\n\r\nThe traditional grand complication watch can be described as having one acoustic complication, one time measurement complication and one calendar complication - of course preferably all as complicated as possible. Patek Philippe however choose to go its own way and create a watch that's based upon the former and the latter, while doing away with the chronographic bits. By no means a short-cut though: the Grandmaster Chime still features 20 complications, among which two that have never been seen before.\r\n\r\nThe first novelty is the Date Repeater - and this one we actually had to add to our WatchBase list of complications. The pusher at 4 o'clock will chime the date at the owners request, with a double chime (ding-dong) for each ten and a single chime for each single digit: 26 would be two double chimes and six single chimes.\r\n\r\nThe second novelty is found in the alarm function. Instead of a buzz, the alarm will chime the hours at which it is set just like the minute repeater - with a built in feature making sure it doesn't chime just once if the alarm is set at say 1:00.\r\n\r\nThe Grandmaster Chime too features Patek's first Petite and Grande Sonnerie, chiming the time 'en passant'. The power reserve for the Sonnerie is set at an impressive 30 hours, which alone is no small feat. All chiming functions share the same barrel, whose power reserve is displayed separately from that of the timekeeping.\r\n\r\nThe case is a baroque work of art, lavishly decorated with engraved leaves - an acquired taste or a testament to the museum-worth quality of this watch?\r\n\r\nThe total of 20 complication is displayed over two dials, with the back dedicated to the perpetual calendar - though of course the 'simple' date display on the front is hooked up to the same perpetual mechanism.\r\n\r\nA total of seven pieces are made, with one being destined to a life in the Patek Philippe Museum. Price is set at 2.5 million CHF.\r\n",

The first minute-repeater wristwatch for women to feature a dial in Grand Feu cloisonné enamel, this haute horlogerie model decorated with rare handcrafts gives center stage to a bird pecking red berries. First, the yellow-gold dial plate was hand-guilloched with a fine panier or basket-weave pattern. Next, the enameler outlined the graceful picture of the bird with outspread wings and the branch, using 58 cm of gold wire (0.32 g) measuring 0.07 x 0.4 mm in cross-section. He then brought the scene to life with a palette of transparent, opaque and opalescent enamels in 21 colors. Each dial required 10 firings at a temperature of approximately 750°C. The rose-gold Calatrava-style case houses the caliber R 27 self-winding movement with minute repeater striking on two gongs. This movement, comprising 342 parts, is visible through a sapphire-crystal case back. The watch also comes with an interchangeable back in solid rose gold.",

To render all the finesse of the facial expression and the wealth of detail displayed in the armor, the marquetry maker cut out and assembled 517 tiny veneer parts and 90 inlays, together spanning a palette of 36 species of wood in different colors, textures and veining.",

It would remain in the collection until the early-mid eighties, when it first was accompanied by the 3450 with leap year indicator (though 3448's with such feature exist too) and later both were replaced by the 3940.\r\n\r\nA total of 586 are said to have been made, with most being cased in yellow gold. Other precious metals -rose, white and platinum- have also appeared on the marked and command a hefty premium over the already steep price of this collectors favorite.\r\n\r\nThe present example, as sold by Antiquorum, is furthermore distinguished by its Cartier signed dial. It was made in 1968.",

In the early eighties it was accompanied by the 3450, which included a leap year indicator. In 1985 the 3940 was introduced, more or less replacing both.\r\n\r\nThe present example, as appeared in an Antiquorum auction, features an integrated bracelet exemplary of the late 70's style - it was manufactured in 1978.",

The clean, understated lines of this platinum Calatrava are the perfect foil for a dial that has exuberant decoration evoking the most exquisite medieval illuminations. The ornamentation alone required more than 30 hours of consummate artistry. Only when the scrollwork was flawless could the engraver intervene to enrich it with the details of emblematic leaves and the fluid, tendril-like curves of arabesques. The caseband is also fluted with enamel volutes. A sapphire crystal caseback reveals the ultra-slim self-winding caliber 240. A platinum prong buckle with hand-engraved decoration fastens the alligator strap.\r\n \r\n",

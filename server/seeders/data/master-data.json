                "description": "Hand-wound movement with perpetual calendar, minute repeater and spherical gyro-tourbillon. The tourbillon is significantly smaller than those in the preceding Gyrotourbillon timepieces. It uses four sets of gongs and hammers to create the Westminster chime to indicate the quarters when the minute repeater is activated, incorporating a complex mechanism that places it at the most prestigious tier of chiming watches and has a silence-reduction function built into its chiming mechanism. This ensures that even when the full set of Westminster quarters is not struck, there is no time delay corresponding to the missing quarters before the minutes are struck. \r\n\r\nA one-minute constant-force mechanism provides a consistent level of power for the energy-hungry tourbillon without affecting its chronometric ability. The constant-force mechanism consists of a spring, known classically as a remontoir d’égalité, that is periodically re-armed by the mainspring and acts as a secondary power source to protect the regulating organ of the movement. This regulates the motion of the minute wheel, creating a jumping minutes hand that offers greater precision in time display. More significantly, the mechanism that controls the minute strike also follows this one-minute jumping system, which completely eliminates the chiming error that can occur when the repeater is activated between minutes, when the chime played and the time shown can be one minute apart.\r\n\r\nThe most common configuration of the perpetual calendar mechanism can only be adjusted in one direction, but the Master Grande Tradition Gyrotourbillon Westminster Perpétuel emphasises the experience and convenience of the user, and its date can be adjusted forwards or backwards without harming the movement. The pointer-style date indication further reinforces the precision aspect of the timepiece, as it jumps over the tourbillon aperture in order to provide the best possible view of the visually stunning rotating escapement.",

            "description": "The star of Patek Phillipe's highly anticipated 175th anniversary collection.\r\n\r\nThe Grandmaster Chime is sans doubt Patek's most impressive feat of modern times. It features an array of functions housed in a massive 47.4 * 16.1mm rose gold case made up of 214 components, while its movement consists of no less than 1.366 parts.\r\n\r\nThe traditional grand complication watch can be described as having one acoustic complication, one time measurement complication and one calendar complication - of course preferably all as complicated as possible. Patek Philippe however choose to go its own way and create a watch that's based upon the former and the latter, while doing away with the chronographic bits. By no means a short-cut though: the Grandmaster Chime still features 20 complications, among which two that have never been seen before.\r\n\r\nThe first novelty is the Date Repeater - and this one we actually had to add to our WatchBase list of complications. The pusher at 4 o'clock will chime the date at the owners request, with a double chime (ding-dong) for each ten and a single chime for each single digit: 26 would be two double chimes and six single chimes.\r\n\r\nThe second novelty is found in the alarm function. Instead of a buzz, the alarm will chime the hours at which it is set just like the minute repeater - with a built in feature making sure it doesn't chime just once if the alarm is set at say 1:00.\r\n\r\nThe Grandmaster Chime too features Patek's first Petite and Grande Sonnerie, chiming the time 'en passant'. The power reserve for the Sonnerie is set at an impressive 30 hours, which alone is no small feat. All chiming functions share the same barrel, whose power reserve is displayed separately from that of the timekeeping.\r\n\r\nThe case is a baroque work of art, lavishly decorated with engraved leaves - an acquired taste or a testament to the museum-worth quality of this watch?\r\n\r\nThe total of 20 complication is displayed over two dials, with the back dedicated to the perpetual calendar - though of course the 'simple' date display on the front is hooked up to the same perpetual mechanism.\r\n\r\nA total of seven pieces are made, with one being destined to a life in the Patek Philippe Museum. Price is set at 2.5 million CHF.\r\n",

The first minute-repeater wristwatch for women to feature a dial in Grand Feu cloisonné enamel, this haute horlogerie model decorated with rare handcrafts gives center stage to a bird pecking red berries. First, the yellow-gold dial plate was hand-guilloched with a fine panier or basket-weave pattern. Next, the enameler outlined the graceful picture of the bird with outspread wings and the branch, using 58 cm of gold wire (0.32 g) measuring 0.07 x 0.4 mm in cross-section. He then brought the scene to life with a palette of transparent, opaque and opalescent enamels in 21 colors. Each dial required 10 firings at a temperature of approximately 750°C. The rose-gold Calatrava-style case houses the caliber R 27 self-winding movement with minute repeater striking on two gongs. This movement, comprising 342 parts, is visible through a sapphire-crystal case back. The watch also comes with an interchangeable back in solid rose gold.",

Other precious metals -rose, white and platinum- have also appeared on the marked and command a hefty premium over the already steep price of this collectors favorite.\r\n\r\nThe present example, as sold by Antiquorum, is furthermore distinguished by its Cartier signed dial.

The ornamentation alone required more than 30 hours of consummate artistry. Only when the scrollwork was flawless could the engraver intervene to enrich it with the details of emblematic leaves and the fluid, tendril-like curves of arabesques. The caseband is also fluted with enamel volutes. A sapphire crystal caseback reveals the ultra-slim self-winding caliber 240. A platinum prong buckle with hand-engraved decoration fastens the alligator strap.\r\n \r\n",

Crafted by hand and fixed to the surface, the scrolls become part of a true picture in relief with its play of light and shade. A hand-engraved arabesque motif adorns the rose-gold Dauphine hands. Twelve diamonds (~0.06 ct) set in rose-gold chatons form the hour circle. The bezel and lugs are set with 113 brilliant-cut Top Wesselton Pure diamonds (~0.8 ct) and the buckle sparkles with 29 diamonds (~0.22 ct).\r\n\r\nHoused in a rose-gold case, the caliber 240 ultra-thin self-winding movement may be admired through the sapphire-crystal back.",

As the last family-owned independent watch manufacturer in Geneva, it enjoys total creative freedom to entirely design, produce and assemble what experts agree to be the finest timepieces in the world – following the vision of its founders Antoine Norbert de Patek (1839) and Adrien Philippe (1845). Thanks to its exceptional know-how, Patek Philippe maintains a tradition of innovation hailed by an impressive repertoire of more than 80 patents."
